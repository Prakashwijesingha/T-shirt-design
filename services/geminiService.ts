         ${accentDetail}
         ${fitInstruction}
         
         STRICT VISUAL ADHERENCE:
         - Match the input image design EXACTLY.
         - If the input shows stripes on the collar, you MUST render them.
         - If the input shows a logo, place it exactly as shown.
         - The fabric should look premium, like high-quality cotton or pique mesh.
      
      2. THE MODEL: Professional ${gender} fashion model, confident pose, facing forward. 
         Skin texture should be hyper-realistic. 
      
      3. ENVIRONMENT: Clean, modern studio background (soft grey or white). 
         Cinematic lighting setup (rim lighting, soft fill) to enhance the 3D form of the shirt.
      
      Output should look like a professional e-commerce product shot from a luxury brand.
